# unity-js-backend
Online repo for the Unity frontend with nodejs backend course.

This is the frontend for a game that communicates with /node-game-backend/ (the backend server).

Players can register themselves, login and search for an opponent before entering the battle.

## TODO

* fix character size on character roster to scale with screen size;
* display turn count;
* reload user info after battle;
