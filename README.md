# unity-js-backend
Online repo for the Unity frontend with nodejs backend course.

This is the frontend for a game that communicates with /node-game-backend/ (the backend server).

Players can register themselves, login and search for an opponent before entering the battle.
In battle, you can choose your action and send them in turns. 
You can also keep track of your battle history in the character selection screen.

* caching images on client;
* displaying 'new turn' message;
* display error messages;
